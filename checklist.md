# End-of-life disaster response

If you are reading this, I, like Tommy, have disappeared to Froopyland and I miss you already. There's a lot here, but the first order of business is telling people.

Contact the following friends and family directly before announcing it on Twitter. Open up my laptop, create a note, then copy/paste it to:

* iMessages: Blake, Brother, Brother 2
* WhatsApp: Aaron
* Facebook: Dad, dad’s phone number is in my phone too
* Skype: Peter
* Discord: Look in my chat list and message anyone I've talked about recently. So far, it's David, Jenn and Claudette.
* Google chat or email: Melanie
* Instagram or email: JoeB

Then let ppl on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram know.

## Tech

This section covers the topics that will help you access my emails and website logins. It'll also let you know who to give my tech things to or who to ask for help when something breaks.

### Emails

As you know, I primarily use me@fake.com. You can login through my phone or laptop. Keep my phone and laptop until you haven't used them for one year just in case a 2FA issue comes up.

* me@fake.com – password is stored in xyz
* this@that.com – all emails from this get forwarded to me@fake.com

Add me@fake.com to your phone, actually, since that's where we get our shipping alerts.

### Domains

* All of my domains are managed via Google Domains and CloudFlare
  * Google Domains auto renews and needs an updated Credit Card to keep going
* xyz.io – Keep this paid via Google Domains or transfer to Danielle Smith 
* fakblog.com – Transfer to Blake

### Password Managers

You know how to use this since we've incorporated it into our lives.

* KeePass. My master password is (printed, no script): _________________________________________

### Subscriptions

* YouTube – keep this for commercial free viewing on Roku or cancel then subscribe from your own account
* Twitch.tv – this is cancelled but recheck and also close my Twitch account
* Discord – cancel this
* Amazon Prime + my “Channels” that you don’t watch. Keep Amazon Prime, cancel my true crime channels.
* Netflix
* Hulu
* Spotify
  * Just keep this account since it’s a family account
* NordVPN
  * It's unlikely you'll need this, just cancel
* Apple Subscriptions
  * Open Apple iPhone
  * Click Settings
  * Click the big thing at the top with my name
  * Click Subscriptions
  * Delete anything you don’t want like Wondery+, Twitter, or Apple News

### Homelabs

* DO NOT SELL WITHOUT FORMATTING OR DESTROYING DISKS. This could be an identity theft disaster.
* Janet can have my “big” black boxes (doesn’t need formatting) and my little black box called a NUC (needs formatting)
* Peter can have my Macs
  * Needs formatting AND needs to follow instructions from Apple to disconnect it from Find My or they’ll be prevented from using it
  * Again, don't give away my laptop or phone until a year after you don't need it
* Ask Peter how to expand Plex but we don’t add anything to it so it shouldn’t be a problem

### Wireless network

* Give Joe all of our Unifi wireless devices if something goes wrong and you can’t bring it up by unplugging for 1 minute and replugging
* Pay him to replace it with something easy. If you move to a smaller place, you can just use the wifi router from the ISP.

### Restarting network services

* If the Internet goes out, restart the black modem like you always do (by waiting 10 seconds). If that doesn't work, unplug it physically, then physically plug it back in.
* If that doesn't work, unplug the white disk upstairs and the white disk downtairs. Wait literally 20 minutes because Unifi is wild and takes forever to restart.
* If that doesn't work either, check to see if there are any voo outages. If not, wait or call Peter.

### Home automation / IoT (Hue, etc)

If you change the name of the wifi (like if you move and use the ISP's built-in wifi), then you will have to reconnect:

* Hue Hub
  * If the Hue lights break, check the Hue Hub upstairs in the storage room; it's a little white square. You probably just need to restart it by unplugging it and waiting 10 seconds.
* Sonos speakers
* Roku, AppleTV and the Firestick
* iRobot vacuum
* Dyson air purifiers
* Ring cameras
* Power consumption monitors
  * Ensure that everything you want to monitor is plugged into a smart plug

Considering that, you might want to ask Michelle to setup the ISP's built-in wifi with the same name of our current wifi (`potatopie`).

### Social Media accounts

* Everything can be logged in with KeePass + the multi-factor apps on my phone (Authy or Microsoft Authenticator)
* Don’t close Twitter for a few years
  * If you sell my Twitter, make it worth your time, like 1 million then ask a friend to delete all my old posts
  * This will probably require some sort of service because Twitter makes things hard
* Export and close FB, I only stayed there for Niki's memorial page and my business page anyway
* Instagram may be enjoyable for you to look back on since it's just us on vacation :kiss:

### 2FA

Fortunately, you're familiar with this because I require you to be :blush:. This is "Two factor authentication" or "2FA" or "Multi factor authentication" or "MFA". They all mean the same thing.

* I use two MFA apps on my phone
  * Authy 
    * I default to this most of the time unless it's not available
  * Microsoft Authenticator
* Some accounts require a US phone number for SMS, so use the me@fake.com Skype account phone number
  * If you see that they sent it to phone number 555-555-5555, then that is the Skype account
* Remember to avoid using SMS for 2FA if it's possible, because it's less safe
* Keep using Authy for your own accounts when you can

### Cloud Subscriptions

SUPER IMPORTANT because these bills can get big quickly

* Microsoft Azure + Power BI - to delete sponsorship subscription and transfer resources – contact Michelle and have her walk you through it. The phone number is listed on [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-support?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=online#phone-support): +1-800-865-9408
* Amazon Web Services charges 5 cents a month and is hooked up to our Amazon account, so you can just leave it forever
* Appveyor – Billy Dominguez will know what to do. Please get in touch with him at some point because if this bill isn't paid each year, then the tests will fail in our repository.

### Online Storage & Photo Backups

**Photo Backups**

We both have this installed on our phones [backup service] is used to backup all our pictures to the cloud, it uploads them automatically so you probably don't know it is there. It is important though as [backup service] contains all of our memories. 

* You can login to the web version [here]() details are in KeePass
* From here you can download individual pictures, change the password to the account or download all of the photos to your computer if you wish.
* Don't just close the account though as you will lose the photos.  

**Cloud Storage** 

We have some documents stored on [cloud storage provider], I also have lots of things stored there that you might want to view, TV License receipts, renewal documents for the car things like that. 

* You can login to the web version [here]() details are in KeePass
* From here you can download individual files, change the password etc. 
* Even if you don't use this it is a good idea to keep it as some of the files you might need in the future.

### Local Storage & Backups 

Like the above online storage and backups we have a NAS, you know the little black box in the closet with the flashing lights on the front, there is a label on it that says [what does it say].

This little black box stores all of our backups that we don't want going to the internet, all of our electronic documents, our films our digital life is on here so it is **IMPORTANT** that If you decide that you don't want to keep it contact [person] who will help you wipe it (delete everything), whatever you do don't just throw it in the bin.

* You can login to the web portal [here]() details are in KeePass
* From here you can view/download individual files, change the password etc. 
* If you login to my computer details also in KeePass you will see a folder called [folder name] this is everything on the NAS, you can navigate through it just like any other folder on the computer. 

### Websites

* BlueHost – let Blake know to look out for a bill each March as this is where fakblog.com is hosted
  * Transfer ownership to Blake and have him contact Bluehost support to reset all passwords
* CloudFlare – this does some advanced shit but is free. Login via Authy. Blake may want to know this too.

### Tech Tips

* Do not EVER sell anything with a hard drive without formatting the hard drives first. Ask any of our tech friends to help.
* Do not EVER try to sell an Apple product without following their instructions to wipe before reselling. Apple is special and associates Find My with your account so it prevents theft. The person won’t be able to use it if you don’t unregister the device.

## Input

This is the section where money lands or exists.

### Bank Accounts and Virtual Currency

We have a couple bank accounts that serve different purposes. One is good for paying international bills, the other comes with some great insurance, and yet another is an old account I've had for a while. It's good for your credit to have a couple bank accounts too.

You use PayPal a lot, so don't close it but feel free to ask a friend to help you change the email addres if you want. It may come with further confirmation.

* Fak Bank
  * Checking / Savings
  * Good loan rates
  * Can pay international bills via IBAN
  * PIN for card: 2553
  * Funds available for immediate use after joint holder is deceased. Spoke with Jan Dodekens and set aside 20,000 euros
* United States Bank 
  * Checking / Savings
  * Has great reputation for car insurance and other insurances
  * Cannot pay IBAN bills
  * PIN for card: Stored in Password1
* First Business of America
  * Get the money out and cancel it
  * It’s an old business account that sometimes came in handy for me but high monthly fees
  * PIN for card: No idea, I don't use it
* PayPal
  * Login with me@fake.com like you always do along with 2FA
* VirtCoin
  * Maybe it’ll make money in the future but right now it’s losing money
  * The app is hard to navigate. Reach out to Emily for help.

### Life Insurance

I get this through my employer.

Fidelity has all of our life insurance and you should receive X amount if I go to Froopyland for natural causes or XX amount if I go to Froopyland due to an accident because our AD&D is maxxed, waxxed and vaxxed.

### Residual income – auto deposits to United States Bank

* Book – Manning
* Twitch (aka Amazon)
* GitHub Sponsors
* Amazon Cookbooks
* Google AdSense

### Investments

Call Fidelity to ask for some advice if you need. I just set it and forget it.

* Fidelity – 401k, investments do well
* Charles Schwab – Investment account, investments do okay
* Victory Capital – Mutual funds. Not a lot here. Their email is email@vc.com

## Output

This is the section with bills and things you gotta pay. Everything is on auto-pay so no stress. Just keep money in Fak Bank and United States Bank.

### Ongoing Insurance Accounts

* State Farm has all of our car and house and umbrella insurances
  * They charge like $100/mo to Fak Bank
* Aetna International Health Insurance
  * The app is on my phone
  * Just pay first, then upload bills and they’ll pay you back

### Credit Cards and Loans

* Chase
  * Emergency Credit Card has 50k limit
  * Has a high APR so don’t use it unless you have to
  * It’s set to auto-pay so if you charge 50k in one month, that’ll be deducted from your bank account at the end of the month so again, be careful
* Fak Bank 
  * Holds our car loan and $550 is deducted each month automatically. Will be paid off in Jan 2025.
* Fannie Mae
  * Holds our student loans, $1200 is deducted each month automatically from Fak Bank. Should be paid off in 3 years. Consider paying these off with insurance money ahead of time to save on interest.

### Cell Phone & Internet

* Auto paid to Orange via our United States Bank account
* Contract ends in 2 years but can be cancelled with 3 months notice
* Billy Dominguez can speak European and can help you navigate cancelling, most likely. Maybe work can too.

### Bill Auto Pay

A few bills are setup to automatically charge us. Rent, however, is setup as a recurring bill. So cancel this when you move. Ask a friend to help you get this in order because you may forget.

* State Farm
  * Car & House insurance, call to update any time you move
* United States Bank
  * Electric company (Electricitease) charges us directly each month
  * Orange charges us $15 each month
  * Student Loan ($1200/mo)
  * State Farm insurance ($100/mo)
* United States Bank
  * This account has recurring bill pay to pay our rent

## Misc

Our accountant Tracey Calendar (tracey@calendarcpa.com) can help you figure out a lot of things and perhaps give you advice on anything I missed. They know our financial history from the past 10 years.
